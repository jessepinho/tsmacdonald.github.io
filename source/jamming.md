In collaboration with the [Illinois St. Andrew Society](http://www.chicagoscots.org/), Tim is leading a Scottish jam session every Tuesday in the month of May.

All sessions will take place at the [Duke of Perth](http://dukeofperth.com/) in Lincoln Park (2913 N Clark St) and begin at 7PM, starting on May 5.
Everyone is encouraged to play their favorite Scottish tunes, but newcomers to the Scottish style might find it useful to look over the collection of [tunes we'll probably play](assets/jam-tunes.pdf).
