Heralded for his "impressive and stylistically Scottish playing" ([Melinda Crawford](http://www.melindacrawford.com/))
and as "a *real* fiddler" ([Bonnie Rideout](http://www.bonnierideout.com/)), Tim Macdonald is a regular performer,
composer, and teacher of Scottish-Baroque music. The reigning US National Scottish Fiddling Champion (and the first to
win the title on a Baroque violin), Tim has performed with [Rachel Barton Pine](http://classical.rachelbartonpine.com/),
[Colyn Fischer](http://www.scotsduo.com/), and [John Turner](http://www.kitchenmusician.net/jink/jinkjohn.html),
among others.  He made his New York debut in a sold-out performance at the Frick Collection as a guest soloist with
[Trio Settecento](http://www.triosettecento.com/), and he has also appeared with the Trio on WQXR classical radio. A
scholar as well as a player, Tim is an Arthur and Lila Weinberg Fellow at the [Newberry Library](http://newberry.org/),
where he will be researching the period-correct performance of Scottish-Baroque music. He also plays the viola d'amore,
harpsichord, and concertina, is a software engineer, and recently ran the Chicago Marathon for charity.

[Contact Tim](/contact.html) to book him for solo performances, Scottish country dances, music workshops,
lectures, and private lessons (in-person in Chicago or remotely via webcam).
