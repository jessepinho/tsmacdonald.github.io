Heralded for his "impressive and stylistically Scottish playing" ([Melinda Crawford](http://www.melindacrawford.com/))
and as "a *real* fiddler" ([Bonnie Rideout](http://www.bonnierideout.com/)), Tim Macdonald is a regular performer,
composer, and teacher of Scottish-Baroque music. A US National Scottish Fiddling Champion (and the first to
win the title on a Baroque violin), Tim has performed with [Trio Settecento](http://www.triosettecento.com/),
[Colyn Fischer](http://www.scotsduo.com/), [John Turner](http://www.kitchenmusician.net/jink/jinkjohn.html), and
the [Bach and Beethoven Ensemble](http://www.bbensemble.org/), among others, in venues ranging from New York City's
Frick Collection to the 1770s Ox Bow Tavern to WQXR classical radio. In addition to performing, Tim runs a private studio
and is on faculty at [The Jink and Diddle School of Scottish Fiddling](http://www.jinkdiddle.com). His compositions have
won the only recent Scottish FIRE Composition Competition and have been published [as a stand-alone collection](/tunes.html).
A scholar as well as a player, Tim is an Arthur and Lila Weinberg Fellow at the [Newberry Library](http://newberry.org/),
where he is researching the period-correct performance of Scottish-Baroque music. He also plays the viola d'amore,
harpsichord, and concertina, serves on the board of the [Great Lakes Baroque](http://www.greatlakesbaroque.org/),
develops software, and recently ran the Chicago Marathon for charity.

[Contact Tim](/contact.html) to book him for solo performances, Scottish country dances, music workshops,
lectures, and private lessons (in-person in Chicago or remotely via webcam).
